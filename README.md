# flickr-free
# by @dphiffer and forked to make a free version
A minimal Flickr search utility for Creative Commons, Public Domain, US Government Work, and "no known copyright" photos.

If you're curious to know how all this works, [flickr-cc.js](https://github.com/dphiffer/flickr-cc/blob/master/flickr-cc.js) has been commented heavily. This uses a simple wrapper library I wrote a while back called [flickr.js](https://github.com/dphiffer/flickr-js/).
